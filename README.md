# My Knowledge Base Management System

This on-going project aims to create a personal knowledge base management system to keep track of my research facts that I gather from literature. This system is designed based on open-source software. Portability of the database and the simplicity of setting up are the key requirements. 

This system is currently built around Neo4j database. It includes a script to start up Neo4j in a Docker container. The data of this database is written to a directory on disk, which can be included in other knowledge repository such as my Commonplace book.
